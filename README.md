## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to our research on the application of graph signal processing (GSP) using the Graph Discrete Fourier transform (GDFT) for the detection Alzheimer Disease in EEG data. It includes all code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, training and evaluation of machine learning models, along with the plots used in our paper.

## Abstract
Alzheimer Disease (AD) poses a significant and growing public health challenge worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention and care. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging Electroen-cephalography (EEG) to improve the detection of AD. This paper focuses on the application of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) techniques using the Graph Discrete Fourier Transform (GDFT) to analyze EEG recordings for the detection of AD, by employing several machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We evaluate our models on publicly available EEG data containing 88 patients categorized into three groups: AD, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Healthy Controls (HC). Binary classification of dementia versus HC reached a top accuracy of 85% (SVM), while multiclass classification of AD, FTD, and HC attained a top accuracy of 44% (Naive Bayes). We provide novel GSP methodology for detecting AD, and form a framework for further experimentation to investigate GSP in the context of other neurodegenerative diseases across multiple data modalities, such as neuroimaging data in Major Depressive Disorder, Epilepsy, and Parkinson disease.
